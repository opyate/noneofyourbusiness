Your random ideas kept safe.

Install
=======

curl -L http://tiny.cc/noyb | sh

Usage
=====

Are you ever in the middle of a quick bit of work you just started, but you need to scoot, or you get interrupted, but you don't have a minute to set up a new Github repo, push, etc.

Just run:

    save /path/to/stuff/you/want/to/keep

Resume work on it later with:

	resume <key>

...where ```key``` is the name yourself (or ```noyb```) chose to save the blob as.
